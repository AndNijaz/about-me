          I am Nijaz Andelić, a twenty-year-old student at the Sarajevo School
          of Science and Technology, majoring in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Since I was little, I have had a desire to become a "Computer Doctor,"
          and I often delved into the abstraction of how computers work. Lego
          bricks probably had an influence on that in my childhood.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          To make a long story short, in Web Development, the field I plan to
          pursue in the future, and hopefully with you at <span>ZENDEV</span>, I
          found myself in the second year of high school when the Covid pandemic
          started. From that day on, I have spent much of my free time learning
          and improving my skills, not only in web development but also in
          programming and computers in general.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Unfortunately, during that period, I didn't have someone to advise me,
          so I tried my hand at many things "related to computers," but in the
          end, I chose web development, and I'm very glad that I know a bit
          about everything and that I decided to dedicate myself 101% to it.
          Along that journey from 2019 to 2023, I have learned a lot of things
          and met many people, which I am very happy about and which has greatly
          improved me.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In addition to programming, I consider myself very good at
          communication and interacting with people, as well as leading and
          managing time. It fills me with joy when I am an active listener and
          can genuinely advise someone or be advised by someone. I also love a
          dynamic atmosphere, and I enjoy being involved in activities,
          especially if I am involved in organizing them.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Recently, in my free time, I started reading books on modern
          psychology and philosophy. In the attachment, you can find the titles
          I have read, as well as the purchased books waiting to be read on my
          shelf.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I consider myself a very ambitious person because I truly have huge
          goals and I am working towards achieving them. I am also very
          charismatic and always strive to be a "smile" and bring positive
          energy to society, no matter how difficult the situation. One of my
          role models is Mr. <span>SENAD ŠANTIĆ</span> because I believe we
          share a similar vision. I am also someone who wants to invest in
          ourselves and create something of our own.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I have learned a lot about people as a member of the Mascot FunTeam
          and working with children. I have gained a lot of positive experiences
          and work habits there. I have been Spiderman, Batman, Mickey Mouse,
          Chase, Rocky, Marshall, Sky, Baby, and many other mascots, as well as
          an entertainer who plans birthday parties and entertains children.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          One of the qualities that characterizes me is discipline and
          self-confidence. I practiced karate for 11 years, which shaped me as a
          person and improved me both physically and mentally. Unfortunately, I
          had to quit karate due to academic reasons, but I haven't given up on
          my athletic life—I continued it in the gym. I have been actively
          training since 2021 and have a good amount of knowledge regarding
          hypertrophy, muscle building, and training.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Let's get back to programming. Regarding my knowledge of web
          development, I consider myself very good at HTML and CSS, and I
          believe I am one of the few who really delved into HTML and CSS in
          detail, not just covering the basics. An example of my well-written
          HTML and CSS can be found at: ->
          <a href="https://github.com/AndNijaz/woldev"
            >https://github.com/AndNijaz/woldev</a
          >
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In addition to HTML and CSS, I believe I have extensive knowledge of
          JavaScript. I have completed the best JavaScript course on Udemy.
          However, I must emphasize that recently I haven't worked on JavaScript
          projects as I focused on my academic obligations (including React).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          As for React, I have also completed a Udemy course on it. However, I
          don't consider my knowledge of React to be that advanced. I would say
          I am at a beginner's level (and to be honest, I haven't coded anything
          in React since last year).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          One of my basic React applications: ->

          >
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I know a lot about web development and how the web actually functions.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Regarding the field of software engineering, I am familiar with terms
          such as object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and
          encapsulation. I am very good at the C++ programming language (to be
          honest, I had an excellent professor, Mr. Željko Jurić, from the
          Faculty of Electrical Engineering, who taught me).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I could write much more on this topic, but I believe this letter has
          already become quite lengthy
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In karate, I have around 40 international medals and hold a
          First-Degree Black Belt.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          In terms of work experience, the only "profession-related" experience
          I have is as an educator at the School & School hackathon. You can see
          a testimonial from that hackathon in one of the attached files.
          Speaking of testimonials, I have a recommendation from a high school
          teacher, as well as an assistant professor from the faculty and a
          person I can rightfully call a true friend. You can also find them
          attached.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          Regarding other work experience, I have worked as a receptionist at
          MHB Fitness gym and as an animator-mascot at Mascot FunTeam.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I would like to thank you for reading this motivational letter. I
          eagerly await your response and look forward to our future
          collaboration. To be honest, I often think about <span>ZENDEV</span>.
          Individuals like <span>Haris Husejnović</span> and
          <span>Valerija Ereš</span> seem to create a fantastic environment for
          growth in various spheres
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I am definitely ready to attend an interview and justify everything I
          have written.
